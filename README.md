# Music Genre Predictor

This project is a music genre predictor that uses machine learning models to predict the genre of a 30 second clip song. It was trained with a dataset of 1000 songs and their respective genres. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification). The dataset contains 10 genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock. The dataset contains 100 30 seconds songs per genre. 

## Project Structure

Each directory has its own README.md file with more information about the project (how to build, how to run, etc).

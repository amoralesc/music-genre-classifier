# Music Genre Classifier

This project is a music genre classifier that uses machine learning models to determine the genre of a 30 second clip song. It was trained with a dataset of 1000 songs and their respective genres. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification) and contains 10 genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock. The dataset contains 100 songs - 30 seconds long per genre. 

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- [Frontend](genre-classifier-app/), developed with ReactJS + Vite
- [Backend](genre-classifier-api/), developed with FastAPI + scikit-learn (Python)

Each directory has its own README.md file with more information about the project (how to build, how to run, etc).
